THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 5
I N T R O D U C T I O N
MUCH LIKE NATURE, life is very often working in our favor,
even when it seems like we are only being faced with adversity, discomfort, and change.
As forest fires are essential to the ecology of the environment—opening new seeds that require heat to sprout and
rebuild a population of trees—our minds also go through
periodic episodes of positive disintegration, or a cleansing
through which we release and renew our self-concept. We
know that nature is most fertile and expansive at its perimeters, where climates meet, and we also transform when we
reach our edge states, the points at which we are forced to
step out of our comfort zones and regroup.1 When we can
no longer rely on our coping mechanisms to help distract us
from the problems in our lives, it can feel as though we’ve
hit rock bottom. The reality is that this sort of awakening is
what happens when we finally come to terms with the problems that have existed for a long time. The breakdown is
often just the tipping point that precedes the breakthrough,
the moment a star implodes before it becomes a supernova.
6 BRIANNA WIEST Just as a mountain is formed when two sections of the
ground are forced against one another, your mountain will
arise out of coexisting but conflicting needs. Your mountain requires you to reconcile two parts of you: the conscious and the unconscious, the part of you that is aware
of what you want and the part of you that is not aware of
why you are still holding yourself back.
Historically, mountains have been used as metaphors for
spiritual awakenings, journeys of personal growth, and
of course, insurmountable challenges that seem impossible to overcome when we are standing at the bottom.
Like so much of nature, mountains provide us with an
inherent wisdom about what it will take to rise up to our
highest potential.
The objective of being human is to grow. We see this reflected back to us in every part of life. Species reproduce,
DNA evolves to eliminate certain strands and develop
new ones, and the edges of the universe are expanding
forever outward. Likewise, our ability to feel the depth
and beauty of life is capable of expanding forever inward
if we are willing to take our problems and see them as catalysts. Forests need fire to do this, volcanoes need implosions, stars need collapse, and human beings often need to
be faced with no other option but to change before they
really do.
To have a mountain in front of you does not mean you
are fundamentally broken in some way. Everything in
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 7
nature is imperfect, and it is because of that imperfection that growth is possible. If everything existed in
uniformity, the gravity that created the stars and planets
and everything that we know would not exist. Without
breaks, faults, and gaps, nothing could grow and nothing
would become.2 The fact that you are imperfect is not a
sign that you have failed; it is a sign that you are human,
and more importantly, it is a sign that you still have more
potential within you.
Maybe you know what your mountain is. Maybe it’s addiction, weight, relationships, jobs, motivation, or money.
Maybe you don’t. Maybe it’s a vague sense of anxiety, low
self-esteem, fear, or a general discontentment that seems
to bleed out onto everything else. The mountain is often
less a challenge in front of us as it is a problem within us,
an unstable foundation that might not seem evident on
the surface but is nonetheless shifting almost every part
of our lives.
Usually when we have a problem that is circumstantial,
we are facing the reality of life. When we have a problem
that is chronic, we are facing the reality of ourselves. We
often think that to face a mountain means to face life’s
hardships, but the truth is that it is almost always because
of the years we have spent accumulating tiny traumas,
adaptations, and coping mechanisms, all of which have
compounded over time.
8 BRIANNA WIEST Your mountain is the block between you and
the life you want to live. Facing it is also the
only path to your freedom and becoming.
You are here because a trigger showed you
to your wound, and your wound will show
you to your path, and your path will show
you to your destiny.
When you arrive at this breaking point—the foot of the
mountain, the heat of the fire, the night that finally wakes
you—you are at the crux of the breakdown, and if you are
willing to do the work, you will find that it is the entryway to the breakthrough you have spent your entire life
waiting for.
Your old self can no longer sustain the life you are trying
to lead; it is time for reinvention and rebirth.
You must release your old self into the fire of your vision
and be willing to think in a way you have never even tried
before. You must mourn the loss of your younger self, the
person who has gotten you this far but who is no longer
equipped to carry you onward. You must envision and
become one with your future self, the hero of your life
that is going to lead you from here. The task in front of
you is silent, simple, and monumental. It is a feat most
do not ever get to the point of attempting. You must now
learn agility, resilience, and self-understanding. You must
change completely, never to be the same again.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 9
The mountain that stands in front of you is the calling
of your life, your purpose for being here, and your path
finally made clear. One day, this mountain will be behind
you, but who you become in the process of getting over it
will stay with you always.
In the end, it is not the mountain that you must master,
but yourself.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 1 1
CHAPTER 1
T H E M O U N TA I N I S Y O U
THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING you back in life more than
yourself.
If there is an ongoing gap between where you are and
where you want to be—and your efforts to close it are
consistently met with your own resistance, pain, and discomfort—self-sabotage is almost always at work.
On the surface, self-sabotage seems masochistic. It appears to be a product of self-hatred, low confidence, or
a lack of willpower. In reality, self-sabotage is simply the
presence of an unconscious need that is being fulfilled by
the self-sabotaging behavior. To overcome this, we must
go through a process of deep psychological excavation. We
must pinpoint the traumatic event, release unprocessed
emotions, find healthier ways to meet our needs, reinvent
our self-image, and develop principles such as emotional
intelligence and resilience.
It is no small task, and yet it is the work that all of us must
do at one point or another.

OBVIOUS AT THE ONSET
When Carl Jung was a child, he fell on the ground in school
and hit his head. When he got hurt, he thought to himself:
“Yes, maybe I won’t have to go back to school now.”3
Though he is known today for his insightful body of work,
he actually didn’t like school or fit in well with his peers.
Shortly after his accident, Jung began experiencing sporadic and uncontrollable fainting spells. He unconsciously
developed what he would call a “neurosis” and ultimately
came to realize that all neuroses are “substitute[s] for legitimate suffering.”
In Jung’s case, he made an unconscious association between fainting and getting out of school. He came to believe that the fainting spells were a manifestation of his
unconscious desire to get out of class, where he felt uncomfortable and unhappy. Likewise, for many people, their fears
and attachments are very often just symptoms of deeper
issues for which they do not have any better way to cope.
S E L F -S A B O TA G E I S
A COPING MECHANISM
Self-sabotage is what happens when we refuse to consciously meet our innermost needs, often because we do
not believe we are capable of handling them.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 1 3
Sometimes, we sabotage our relationships because what
we really want is to find ourselves, though we are afraid
to be alone. Sometimes, we sabotage our professional success because what we really want is to create art, even if
it will make us seem less ambitious by society’s measures.
Sometimes, we sabotage our healing journey by psychoanalyzing our feelings, because doing so ensures we avoid
actually experiencing them. Sometimes, we sabotage our
self-talk because if we believed in ourselves, we’d feel free
to get back out in the world and take risks, and that would
leave us vulnerable.
In the end, self-sabotage is very often just a maladaptive
coping mechanism, a way we give ourselves what we need
without having to actually address what that need is. But
like any coping mechanism, it is just that — a way to cope.
It’s not an answer, it’s not a solution, and it does not ever
truly solve the problem. We are merely numbing our desires, and giving ourselves a little taste of temporary relief.
S E L F -S A B O TA G E C O M E S F R O M
IRRATIONAL FEAR
Sometimes, our most sabotaging behaviors are really the
result of long-held and unexamined fears we have about
the world and ourselves.
Perhaps it is the idea that you are unintelligent, unattractive, or disliked. Perhaps it is the idea of losing a job,
1 4 BRIANNA WIEST taking an elevator, or committing to a relationship. In
other cases, it can be more abstract, such as the concept of
someone “coming to get” you, violating your boundaries,
getting “caught,” or being wrongly accused.
These beliefs become attachments over time.
For most people, the abstract fear is really a representation of a legitimate fear. Because it would be too scary to
actually dwell on the real fear, we project those feelings
onto issues or circumstances that are less likely to occur. If
the situation has an extremely low likelihood of becoming
reality, it therefore becomes a “safe” thing to worry about,
because subconsciously, we already know it isn’t going to
happen. Therefore, we have an avenue to express our feelings without actually endangering ourselves.
For example, if you are someone who is deeply afraid of
being a passenger in a car, maybe your real fear is the loss
of control or the idea that someone or something else is
controlling your life. Perhaps the fear is of “moving forward,” and the moving car is simply a representation of that.
If you were aware of the real issue, you could begin working to resolve it, perhaps by identifying the ways you are
giving up your power or being too passive. However, if you
aren’t aware of the real problem, you’ll continue to spend
your time trying to convince yourself to not be triggered
and anxious while riding in the car and find that it only
gets worse.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 1 5
If you try to fix the problem on the surface, you will always come up against a wall. This is because you’re trying
to rip off a Band-Aid before you have a strategy to heal
the wound.

U N C O N S C I O U S , N E G AT I V E
ASSOCIATIONS
Self-sabotage is also one of the first signs that your inner
narrative is outdated, limiting, or simply incorrect.
Your life is defined not only by what you think about it,
but also what you think of yourself. Your self-concept is
an idea that you have spent your whole life building. It
was created by piecing together inputs and influences
from those around you: what your parents believed, what
your peers thought, what became self-evident through
personal experience, and so on. Your self-image is difficult
to adjust, because your brain’s confirmation bias works to
affirm your preexisting beliefs about yourself.
When we self-sabotage, it is often because we have a negative association between achieving the goal we aspire to
and being the kind of person who has or does that thing.
If your issue is that you want to be financially stable, and
yet you keep ruining every effort you make to get there,
you have to go back to your first concept of money. How
1 6 BRIANNA WIEST did your parents manage their finances? More importantly, what did they tell you about people who had it and
people who didn’t? Many people who struggle financially
will justify their place in life by disavowing money as a
whole. They will say that all rich people are terrible. If you
grew up with people who told you your entire life that
people who have money are this way, guess what you’re
going to resist having?
Your anxiety around the issue that you’re self-sabotaging
is usually a reflection of your limiting belief.
Maybe you associate being healthy with being vulnerable,
because you had a parent who was perfectly healthy when
they suddenly fell ill. Maybe you aren’t writing your magnum opus because you don’t really want to write; you just
want to be seen as “successful” because that will get you
praise, which is typically what people revert to when they
want acceptance but haven’t gotten it. Maybe you keep
eating the wrong foods because they soothe you, but you
haven’t stopped to ask what they have to keep soothing
you from. Maybe you aren’t really a pessimist but don’t
know how to connect with the people in your life other
than by complaining to them.
In order to reconcile this, you have to begin to challenge
these preexisting ideas and then adopt new ones.
You have to be able to recognize that not everybody
with money is corrupt, not by a long shot. Even more
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 1 7
importantly, given that there are people who use their
money in selfish ways, it is even more important that
good people with great intentions are fearless in pursuit
of acquiring this essential tool to create more time, opportunity, and wellness for themselves and others. You have
to recognize that being healthy makes you less vulnerable,
not more, and that criticism comes with creating anything
for the public and isn’t a reason to not do it. You have to
show yourself that there are many different ways to selfsoothe that are more effective than unhealthy food choices and that there are far better ways to connect with others
than through negativity.
Once you begin to really question and observe these preexisting beliefs, you begin to see how warped and illogical
they were all along—not to mention distinctly holding
you back from your ultimate potential.
S E L F -S A B O TA G E C O M E S F R O M
WHAT’S UNFAMILIAR
Human beings experience a natural resistance to the unknown, because it is essentially the ultimate loss of control. This is true even if what’s “unknown” is benevolent or
even beneficial to us.
Self-sabotage is very often the simple product of unfamiliarity, and it is because anything that is foreign, no matter how good, will also be uncomfortable until it is also
1 8 BRIANNA WIEST familiar. This often leads people to confuse the discomfort
of the unknown with being “wrong” or “bad” or “ominous.”
However, it is simply a matter of psychological adjustment.
Gay Hendricks calls this your “upper limit,” or your tolerance for happiness.4
 Everyone has a capacity for which
they allow themselves to feel good. This is similar to what
other psychologists refer to as a person’s “baseline,” or
their set predisposition that they eventually revert back to,
even if certain events or circumstances shift temporarily.
Small shifts, compounded over time, can result in permanent baseline adjustments. However, they often don’t
stick because we come up on our upper limits. The reason
we don’t allow those shifts to become baselines is because
as soon as our circumstances extend beyond the amount
of happiness we’re accustomed to, we find ways both conscious and unconscious to bring ourselves back to a feeling we’re comfortable with.
We are programmed to seek what we’ve known. Even
though we think we’re after happiness, we’re actually trying to find whatever we’re most used to.
S E L F -S A B O TA G E C O M E S
FROM BELIEF SYSTEMS
What you believe about your life is what you will make
true about your life.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 1 9
That’s why it’s so crucial to be aware of these outdated
narratives and have the courage to change them.
Maybe you have gone through the majority of your life
believing that a standard $50K per year salary at a decent company is the most you’ll ever be capable of. Maybe
you’ve spent so many years telling yourself: “I am an
anxious person,” you started to actually identify with it,
adopting anxiety and fear into your belief system about
who you fundamentally are. Maybe you were raised in a
closed-minded social circle or an echo chamber. Maybe
you did not know that you could question or arrive at new
conclusions about politics or religion. Maybe you never
thought you were someone who could have great style,
feel content, or travel the world.
In other cases, your limiting beliefs might come from
wanting to keep yourself safe.
Maybe that’s why you prefer the comfort of what you’ve
known to the vulnerability of what you don’t, why you
prefer apathy to excitement, think that suffering makes
you more worthy, or believe that for every good thing in
life, there must also be an accompanying “bad.”
To truly heal, you are going to have to change the way you
think. You are going to have to become very conscious of
negative and false beliefs and start shifting to a mindset
that actually serves you.
2 0 BRIANNA WIEST HOW TO GET OUT OF DENIAL
Maybe this preliminary information about self-sabotage
resonates a bit, or maybe it resonates a lot.
Either way, if you are here because you truly want to
change your life, you are going to have to stop being in
denial about your personal state of affairs. You are going
to have to get real with yourself. You are going to have to
decide that you love yourself too much to stop settling for
less than what you really deserve.
If you think that you could be doing better in life, you
might be right.
If you think that there is more that you are here to accomplish, you might be right.
If you think that you are not being your authentic self, you
might be right.
It does not serve us to use endless affirmations to placate
our true feelings about where we are in our journey. When
we do this, we start dissociating and get stuck.
In an effort to “love ourselves,” we try to validate everything about who we are. Yet those warm sentiments
never quite seem to stick, only ever temporarily numbing the discomfort. Why don’t they work? Because
deep down, we know we are not quite being who we
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 2 1
want to be, and until we accept this, we are never going
to find peace.
When we are in denial, we tend to go into “blame” mode.
We look for anyone or anything to explain why we are
the way we are. Then we start justifying. If you have to
constantly—on a near daily basis—rationalize why you’re
unhappy about your life, you are not doing yourself any favors. You are not getting any closer to creating the lasting
change that you so deeply desire.
The first step in healing anything is taking full accountability. It is no longer being in denial about the honest
truth of your life and yourself. It does not matter what
your life looks like on the outside; it is how you feel about
it on the inside. It is not okay to be constantly stressed,
panicked, and unhappy. Something is wrong, and the
longer you try to “love yourself ” out of realizing this, the
longer you are going to suffer.
The greatest act of self-love is to no longer
accept a life you are unhappy with. It is to
be able to state the problem plainly and in a
straightforward manner.
That is precisely what you need to do to continue truly
uprooting your life and transforming it. It is the first step
towards real change.
2 2 BRIANNA WIEST Take a piece of paper and a pen, and write down everything you aren’t happy with. Write down, very specifically,
every single problem you face. If you are struggling with
finances, you need a very clear picture of what’s wrong.
Write down every debt, every bill, every asset, and every
bit of income. If you are struggling with self-image, write
down exactly what you dislike about yourself. If it is anxiety, write down everything that bothers or upsets you.
You must first and foremost get out of denial and into
clarity about what’s really wrong. At this point, you have a
choice: You can make peace, or you can commit to changing. The lingering is what is keeping you stuck.
THE PATH BEGINS RIGHT
W H E R E Y O U A R E N O W
If you know that change needs to be made in your life, it
is okay if you are far away from your goal or if you cannot
yet conceive how you will arrive.
It is okay if you are starting at the beginning.
It is okay if you are at rock bottom and cannot yet see your
way through.
It is okay if you are at the foot of your mountain and have
failed every time you’ve tried to overcome it.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 2 3
Rock bottom is very often where we begin on our healing journey. This is not because we suddenly see the light,
not because our worst days are magically transmuted into
some type of epiphany, and not because someone saves
us from our own madness. Rock bottom becomes a turning point because it is only at that point that most people
think: I never want to feel this way again.
That thought is not just an idea. It is a declaration and
a resolution. It is one of the most life-changing things
you can ever experience. It becomes the foundation upon
which you build everything else.
When you decide you truly do not ever want to feel a certain way again, you set out on a journey of self-awareness,
learning, and growth that has you radically reinvent who
you are.
In that moment, fault becomes irrelevant. You’re no longer
mulling over who did what or how you’ve been wronged.
In that moment, only one thing guides you, and it is this:
No matter what it takes, I will never accept my life getting
to this point again.
Rock bottom isn’t a bad day. It doesn’t happen by chance.
We only arrive at rock bottom when our habits begin to
compound upon one another, when our coping mechanisms have spiraled so out of control that we can no longer resist the feelings we were attempting to hide. Rock
bottom is when we are finally faced with ourselves, when
2 4 BRIANNA WIEST everything has gone so wrong, we are left to realize that
there is only one common denominator through it all.
We must heal. We must change. We must choose to turn
around so that we will never feel this way again.
When we have a down day, we don’t think: I never want to
feel this way again. Why? Because it is not fun, but it’s also
not unbearable. Mostly, though, we are somewhat aware
that small failures are a regular part of life; we are imperfect but trying our best, and that vague discomfort will
pass eventually.
We don’t reach a breaking point because one or two
things go wrong. We reach a breaking point when we
finally accept that the problem isn’t how the world is; it
is how we are. This is a beautiful reckoning to have. Ayodeji Awosika describes his own like this: “You must find
the purest, purest, purest form of being fed up. Make it
hurt. I literally screamed, ‘I’m not going to fucking live
like this anymore!’”
Human beings are guided by comfort. They
stay close to what feels familiar and reject
what doesn’t, even if it’s objectively better
for them.
Be this as it is, most people do not actually change their
lives until not changing becomes the less comfortable
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 2 5
option. This means that they do not actually embrace the
difficulty of altering their habits until they simply do not
have another choice. Staying where they are is not viable.
They can no longer even pretend that it is desirable in any
way. They are, quite honestly, less at rock bottom and more
stuck between a rock that’s impinging on them and an
arduous climb out from beneath it.
If you really want to change your life, let yourself be consumed with rage: not toward others, not with the world,
but within yourself.
Get angry, determined, and allow yourself to develop tunnel vision with one thing and one thing only at the end:
that you will not go on as you are.
P R E PA R I N G F O R R A D I C A L C H A N G E
One of the biggest reasons that people avoid doing important internal work is that they recognize if they heal
themselves, their lives will change—sometimes drastically.
If they come to terms with how unhappy they are, it means
that they will have to temporarily be more uncomfortable,
ashamed, or scared while they start all over.
Let’s be clear about something: To put an end to your
self-sabotaging behavior absolutely means that change is
on the horizon.
2 6 BRIANNA WIEST Your new life is going to cost you your old one.
It’s going to cost you your comfort zone and your sense
of direction.
It’s going to cost you relationships and friends.
It’s going to cost you being liked and understood.
It doesn’t matter.
The people who are meant for you are going to meet you
on the other side. You’re going to build a new comfort
zone around the things that actually move you forward.
Instead of being liked, you’re going to be loved. Instead of
being understood, you’re going to be seen.
All you’re going to lose is what was built for a person you
no longer are.
Remaining attached to your old life is the first and final
act of self-sabotage, and releasing it is what we must prepare for to truly be willing to see real change.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 2 7
CHAPTER 2
T H E R E ’ S N O S U C H T H I N G A S
S E L F -S A B O TA G E
WHEN YOU HABITUATE YOURSELF to do things that move
your life forward, you call them skills. When they hold
your life back, you call them self-sabotage. They are both
essentially the same function.
Sometimes, it happens by accident. Sometimes, we just
get used to living a certain way and fail to have a vision for
how life could be different. Sometimes, we make choices
because we don’t know how to make better ones or that
anything else is even possible. Sometimes, we settle for
what we’re handed because we don’t know we can ask for
more. Sometimes, we run our lives on autopilot for long
enough that we begin to think we no longer have a choice.
However, most of the time, it’s not accidental at all. The
habits and behaviors you can’t stop engaging in—no matter how destructive or limiting they may be—are intelligently designed by your subconscious to meet an unfulfilled need, displaced emotion, or neglected desire.
2 8 BRIANNA WIEST Overcoming self-sabotage is not about
trying to figure out how to override your
impulses; it is first determining why those
impulses exist in the first place.
Self-sabotage is often misunderstood to be a way in which
we punish, deride, or intentionally hurt ourselves. On the
surface, this seems true enough. Self-sabotage is committing to a healthier diet and finding yourself pulling up to
the drive-thru a few hours later. It’s identifying a market
gap, conceiving an unprecedentedly brilliant business idea,
then getting “distracted” and forgetting to begin working
on it. It’s having strange and terrifying thoughts and allowing them to paralyze you in the face of important life
changes or milestones. It is knowing you have so much to
be grateful for and excited about and yet worrying anyway.
We often misattribute these behaviors to a lack of intelligence, willpower, or capability. That is usually not the case.
Self-sabotage is not a way we hurt ourselves; it’s a way we
try to protect ourselves.
WHAT IS SELF-SABOTAGE?
Self-sabotage is when you have two conflicting desires.
One is conscious, one is unconscious. You know how you
want to move your life forward, and yet you are still, for
some reason, stuck.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 2 9
When you have big, ongoing, insurmountable issues in
your life—especially when the solutions seem so simple,
so easy, and yet so impossible to stick with—what you
have are not big problems but big attachments.
People are pretty incredible in the fact that they basically
do whatever they want to do.
This is true of everything in human life. Regardless of the
potential consequences, human nature has revealed itself
to be incredibly self-serving. People have an almost superhuman way of doing whatever they feel compelled to
do, regardless of whom it could hurt, what wars it could
spawn, or what future would be put at risk. When you
consider this, you begin to realize that if you’re keeping
something in your life, there has to be a reason you want
it there. The only question is why.
Some people can’t figure out why they can’t seem to
motivate themselves enough to create a new business to
facilitate their goal of becoming significantly wealthier,
perhaps not realizing that they have a subconscious belief
that to be rich is to be egocentric or disliked. Or perhaps
they actually don’t want to be super-wealthy. Maybe it’s
a cover-up for wanting to feel secure and “taken care of,”
or their real desire is to be recognized for their art, and as
this feels too unlikely to ever happen, they fall back on a
secondary dream that doesn’t actually motivate them.
Some people say that they want to be successful at any
3 0 BRIANNA WIEST cost and yet don’t want to log the hours of work it would
take to get there. Perhaps it is because they understand
at some level that being “successful” doesn’t really make
you happy nor liked. In fact, the opposite tends to be true.
Success usually exposes you to jealousy and scrutiny. Successful people are not loved in the way that we imagine
they would be; they are usually picked apart because envious people need to humanize them in some way. Perhaps
instead of being “successful,” what many really want is just
to be loved, and yet their ambition for success directly
threatens that.
Some people can’t figure out why they keep choosing the
“wrong” relationships, people whose patterns of rejection, abuse, or refusal to commit seem to be consistent.
Perhaps they don’t realize that they are actually re-creating the relationship dynamics they experienced when
they were young because they associate love with loss
or abandonment. Perhaps they want to re-create family
relationships in which they felt helpless, but to live them
again as an adult where they can help the addict, the liar,
or the broken person.
When it comes to self-sabotaging behaviors, you have to
understand that sometimes, it’s easy to get attached to having problems.
Being successful can make you less liked.
Finding love can make you more vulnerable.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 3 1
Making yourself less attractive can guard you.
Playing small allows you to avoid scrutiny.
Procrastinating puts you back in a place of comfort.
All the ways in which you are self-sabotaging are actually
ways that you are feeding a need you probably do not even
realize you have. Overcoming it is not only a matter of
learning to understand yourself better, but realizing that
your problems are not problems; they are symptoms.
You cannot get rid of the coping mechanisms and think
you’ve solved the problem.
WHAT DOES SELF-SABOTAGE
LOOK LIKE?
It’s impossible to say decisively what self-sabotage does
or doesn’t look like, because certain habits and behaviors
that can be healthy for one person can be unhealthy in
another context.
With that said, there are definitely some specific behaviors and patterns that are typically indicative of self-sabotage, and they usually relate to being aware that there’s
a problem in your life, yet feeling the need to perpetuate
it regardless. Here are some of the main signs that you’re
probably in a cycle of self-sabotage.
3 2 BRIANNA WIEST RESISTANCE
Resistance is what happens when we have a new project
that we need to work on and simply can’t bring ourselves
to do it. It’s when we get into a great new relationship
and then keep bailing on plans. It’s when we get an
amazing idea for our business and then feel tension and
anger when it comes time to sit down and actually get
to work.
We often feel resistance in the face of what’s going right in
our lives, not what’s going wrong. When we have a problem
to solve, resistance is usually nowhere to be found. But when
we have something to enjoy, create, or build, we are tapping
into a part of ourselves that is trying to thrive instead of just
survive, and the unfamiliarity can be daunting.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Resistance is your way of slowing down and making sure
that it’s safe to get attached to something new and important. In other cases, it can also be a warning sign that
something isn’t quite right, and you might need to step
back and regroup.
Resistance is not the same thing as procrastination or
indifference and shouldn’t be treated as such. When we
are experiencing resistance, there is always a reason, and
we have to pay attention. If we try to force ourselves to
perform in the face of resistance, it usually intensifies the
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 3 3
feeling, as we are strengthening the internal conflict and
triggering the fear that’s holding us back in the first place.
Instead, releasing resistance requires us to refocus. We
have to get clear on what we want as well as when and
why we want it. We have to identify unconscious beliefs
that are preventing us from showing up, and then we have
to step back into the work when we feel inspired. Wanting
is the entryway to showing up after resistance.
H I T T I N G Y O U R U P P E R L I M I T
As discussed before, there is only a certain amount of happiness that most of us will allow ourselves to feel. Gay
Hendricks calls this your “upper limit.”
Your upper limit is essentially the amount of “good” that
you’re comfortable having in your life. It is your tolerance
and threshold for having positive feelings or experiencing
positive events.
When you begin to surpass your upper limit, you start
to unconsciously sabotage what’s happening in order to
bring yourself back to what’s comfortable and familiar.
For some people, this manifests physically, often as aches,
pains, headaches, or physical tension. For others, it manifests emotionally as resistance, anger, guilt, or fear.
It might seem totally counterintuitive, but we are not
3 4 BRIANNA WIEST really wired to be happy; we are wired to be comfortable,
and anything that is outside of that realm of comfort feels
threatening or scary until we are familiar with it.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Hitting your upper limit is a really great sign. It means
that you’re approaching and surpassing new levels of
your life, and that is first and foremost something to
congratulate yourself for. The way you resolve an upper-limit problem is by slowly acclimating yourself to
your new “normal.”
Instead of shocking yourself into big changes, allow yourself to slowly adjust and adapt. By taking it slow, you are
allowing yourself to gradually reinstate a new comfort
zone around what you want your life to be. Over time, you
gradually shift your baseline to a new standard.
U P R O O T I N G
Uprooting happens when someone finds themselves
jumping from relationship to relationship or changing
their business website again and again, when they really need to focus on confronting relationship issues when
they arise or taking care of clients they already have. In
uprooting, you are not allowing yourself to blossom; you
are only comfortable with the process of sprouting.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 3 5
It might be constantly needing a “fresh start,” which is
often the result of not having healthy ways to deal with
stress or struggling with conflict resolution. Uprooting can
be a way of diverting attention from the actual problems
in your life, as your attention must go toward reestablishing oneself at a new job or in a new town.
Ultimately, uprooting means you are always just beginning your new chapter but never really finishing it. Despite your efforts to keep moving on, you end up more
stuck than ever before.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
First, recognize the pattern.
One of the primary symptoms of uprooting is not realizing that one is doing it. Therefore, the most important
step is to become aware of what’s happening. Trace back
your steps over the past few years: How many places have
you moved or worked? Then figure out what is driving you
away from each new thing you find.
Next, you need to get clear on what you really want.
Sometimes, uprooting occurs because we step too quickly
toward what we think we want, only to find that we didn’t
think it through and don’t really want that thing very
much. Clarity is key, because you’re thinking long-term
now. What would it look like to choose one place to live,
then build connections there? What would it look like to
3 6 BRIANNA WIEST work at the same place and move up in your position or
build your business?
Remember that healing from an uprooting pattern is
not about settling for something you don’t want, nor is it
about staying in an unsafe or unhealthy situation because
you don’t want to move again. It’s about getting clear and
determined on what’s the right path for you and then
making a plan for how you can thrive, not just survive.
When the moment comes that you would typically flee,
confront the discomfort and stay where you are. Figure
out why you are uncomfortable getting attached to one
thing or another, and determine what a healthy attachment would look like for you.
P E R F E C T I O N I S M
When we expect that our work must be perfect the first time
we do it, we end up getting into a cycle of perfectionism.
Perfectionism isn’t actually wanting everything to be
right. It’s not a good thing. In fact, it is a hindering thing,
because it sets up unrealistic expectations about what we
are capable of or what the outcomes of our lives could be.
Perfectionism holds us back from showing up and trying,
or really doing the important work of our lives. This happens because when we are afraid of failing, or feeling vulnerable, or not being as good as we want others to think
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 3 7
we are, we end up avoiding the work that is required to
actually become that good. We sabotage ourselves because
it is the willingness to show up and simply do it, again
and again and again, that ultimately brings us to a place
of mastery.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Don’t worry about doing it well; just do it.
Don’t worry about writing a bestseller, just write. Don’t
worry about making a Grammy-winning hit, just make
music. Don’t worry about failing, just keep showing up
and trying. At first, all that matters is that you do what
you really want to do. From there, you can learn from your
mistakes and over time get to the place where you really
want to be.
The truth is that we actually do not accomplish great feats
when we are anxious about whether or not what we do will
indeed be something impressive and world-changing. We
accomplish these sorts of things when we simply show up
and allow ourselves to create something meaningful and
important to us.
Instead of perfection, focus on progress. Instead of having
something done perfectly, focus on just getting it done.
From there, you can edit, build, grow, and develop it to
exactly what your vision is. But if you don’t get started,
you’ll never arrive.

PROCESSING SKILLS
In life, there are going to be people, situations, and circumstances that are upsetting, infuriating, saddening, and
even enraging. There will likewise be people, situations,
and circumstances that are inspiring, hopeful, helpful, and
truly offer purpose and meaning in your life.
When you are only able to process half of your emotions,
you stunt yourself. You start going out of your way to avoid
any possible situation that could bring up something frustrating or uncomfortable, because you have no tools to
be able to handle that feeling. This means that you start
avoiding the very risks and actions that would ultimately
change your life for the better.
In addition, an inability to process your emotions
means you get stuck with them. You sit and dwell on
your anger and sadness because you don’t know how to
make them go away. When we can only process half of
our emotions, we ultimately only live half of the life we
really want to.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Healthy emotional processing looks different for everyone
but generally involves these steps:
• Get clear on what happened.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 3 9
• Validate your feelings.
• Determine a course correction.
First, you need to understand why you’re upset or the reason why something is bothering you so much. Without
clarity on this, you’ll continue to waste your time mulling
over the details without really understanding what’s hurting you so much.
Next, you have to validate how you feel. Recognize that
you are not alone; anyone in your situation would probably feel similarly (and does) and that what you feel is
absolutely okay. In doing this, you can allow yourself a
physical release such as crying, shaking, journaling about
what you feel, or talking to a trusted friend.
Once you are clear on what’s wrong and have allowed
yourself to fully express the extent of your emotions, you
can determine how you will change your behavior or
thought process so that you get an outcome that you really
want in the future.
J U S T I F I C AT I O N
Your life is ultimately measured by your outcomes, not
your intentions. It is not about what you wanted to do or
would have done but didn’t have the time. It’s not about
why you thought you couldn’t; it’s just whether or not you
4 0 BRIANNA WIEST eventually did. When you’re in a pattern of self-sabotaging behavior, you’re often treating those excuses the same
way you would treat measurable outcomes: You’re using
them to make yourself feel momentarily satisfied, using
them as a replacement for the accomplishment itself.
When we have a goal, dream, or plan, there is no measure
of intent. It is only whether you did it or did not. Any
other reason you offer for not showing up and doing the
work is simply you stating that you prioritize that reason
over your ultimate ambition, which means that it will always take precedence in your life.
You may also be using excuses to help navigate away from
uncomfortable feelings that are ultimately necessary for
your growth.
HOW YOU RESOLVE THIS
Start measuring your outcomes and focusing on at least
doing one productive thing each day.
It’s no longer about how many days you really wanted
to go to the gym; it’s about how many days you did. It’s
no longer about wanting to show up for your friends; it’s
whether or not you did. It’s no longer about the great
ideas you had about how to change your business; it’s
about whether or not you did.
Stop accepting your own excuses. Stop being complacent
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 4 1
with your own justifications. Start quantifying your days
by how many healthy, positive things you accomplished,
and you will see how quickly you begin to make progress.
D I S O R G A N I Z AT I O N
By leaving our lives and spaces in disarray, we are not just
mindlessly forgetting to take care of our surroundings.
We are often actually creating distractions and chaos that
serve an unconscious purpose.
A clean, organized space—both for work and for living—
is essential to thriving. This means a tidy home, clothes
that are easy to reach and put together each morning, a
clean kitchen, and an organized desk. Paperwork should
be filed in one space, your bedroom should be calming,
and everything should have a “home” that it can return to
at the end of the day.
Without cleanliness, we create fewer opportunities for
ourselves. Nothing positive, nor beautiful, flows from
chaos. Deep down, we know this. Often, when we are
self-sabotaging through disorganization, it is because
when we are very clean or organized, we get an uneasy
feeling. That uneasy feeling is what we are trying to avoid,
because it is the recognition that now that everything is in
order, we must get to work on doing what we need to do
or who we want to become.
4 2 BRIANNA WIEST When we leave our spaces messy, we are always a few tasks
or priorities away from stepping out and showing up.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Like anything, you need to start slow and adjust yourself over time. To declutter and reorganize, start with one
room, and if that is too much, try one corner, drawer, or
closet. Work on that, and only that, and then implement a
routine that maintains the organization.
From there, start arranging your space so that it works
for you, not against you. Put something soothing on your
bedside table like a diffuser, or create an organized family
calendar in the kitchen so appointments and schedules are
visible to others. If you have trouble with the mail being
disorganized, create a spot for it to go when it comes in
each day. If you have trouble with laundry being disorganized, create a system for it and decide on a day or two
that you do the wash, and do it in bulk.
You must slowly let yourself get used to working at a clean
desk, and eventually it will become second nature. You’ll
begin to realize that you also feel so much less stressed
and much more in control of your life.
It is very hard to show up as the person you want to be
when you are surrounded by an environment that makes
you feel like a person you aren’t.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 4 3
AT TA C H M E N T T O W H AT Y O U
DON’T REALLY WANT
Sometimes, your dreams for your life are adopted from
other people’s preferences. In other cases, you determine
what you want and then you outgrow your old ambitions.
Sometimes, we fight endlessly to try to force ourselves to
want something that we do not really want, and it always
leaves us empty, because it isn’t a genuine desire. This is
different than lacking motivation or experiencing resistance. Our inability to perform is not based in fear or lack
of skill, it is based in an inherent knowing that this is not
what we want for our lives, and perhaps we’re feeling lost
or unable to change our path.
When you find yourself struggling with something, you
have to ask yourself: Do I actually want to do this? Do you
want the job, or do you just like how the title sounds? Are
you in love with the person, or do you like the idea of
the relationship? Are you still holding an outdated idea of
what your greatest success will be, and if so, what would it
look like to let that go?
At the end of the day, self-sabotage sometimes functions
to show us that we aren’t quite on the right path yet, and
that we need to reevaluate to determine what would feel
best for our lives, even if that means we disappoint some
people or even our younger selves.
4 4 BRIANNA WIEST We do not have to live the rest of our lives trying to achieve
some measure of success we thought was ideal when we
were too young to understand who we even were. Our
only responsibility is to make decisions for the person we
have become.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Be willing to accept that maybe your “success story” doesn’t
look the way that you once thought it might.
Maybe the kind of success you’re really hungry for is to
feel at peace each day, or making your life about travel
instead of work. Maybe it’s about having thriving friendships or a happy relationship. Maybe the business you got
into 10 years ago isn’t the business you want to be in forever. Maybe the work you thought you’d love isn’t coming
as naturally to you as you’d hoped.
When we let go of what isn’t right for us, we create space
to discover what is. However, doing so requires the tremendous courage to put our pride aside and see things for
what they really are.
JUDGING OTHERS
We all know that gossiping, or judging other people’s lives
and choices, is not a healthy or positive way to connect
with other people. However, it does far more damage than
we realize, as it sets up barriers to our own success.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 4 5
If we feel bad about not being as successful as another
person, we might try to find something negative about
them to make ourselves feel better. If we do that every
time we come across a person who is more successful than
we are, we begin to associate that level of success with
being disliked. When it comes time for us to take action
to move our lives forward, we’re going to resist doing it,
because becoming more successful will create a breach in
our self-concept.
In other cases, you might have heard people you grew up
around villainizing others who had money. They might
have said things like, “Ugh, rich people are the worst.”
Maybe they chalked all wealthy people up to being morally corrupt. This sweeping characterization sealed itself in
your subconscious, and now you find yourself sabotaging
your own attempts to become financially healthy, because
you associate it with guilt and being disliked.
When we set up judgments for others, they become rules
that we have to play by, too. By judging others for what
we don’t have or because we envy them, we sabotage our
own lives far more than we ever really hurt anybody else.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Many people say that you have to love yourself first before
you can love others, but really, if you learn to love others,
you will learn to love yourself.
4 6 BRIANNA WIEST Practice non-judgment through non-assumption. Instead
of reaching a conclusion about a person based on the
limited information you have about them, consider that
you’re not seeing the whole picture and don’t know the
whole story.
When you are more compassionate about other people’s
lives, you become more compassionate about your own.
When you see someone who has something you want,
congratulate them, even if it feels hard at first. It will extend back and open you up to receiving it as well.
PRIDE
Pride is often involved in many of our worst decisions.
Sometimes, we know a relationship is wrong, but the
shame of leaving seems worse than staying. Sometimes,
we start a business and realize we don’t really like it very
much or refuse to accept that we need to change or ask
for help. In these cases, our pride is getting in the way. We
are making decisions based on how we imagine people
view our lives, not how they actually are. This is not only
inaccurate, but it is also very unhealthy.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
To overcome our attachment to pride, we have to start to
see ourselves more wholly and honestly.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 4 7
Instead of thinking that we need to prove to everyone
around us how perfect and flawless we are, we can imagine ourselves more realistically: as people who, despite our
weaknesses, are trying our best. In the end, it looks far
worse to hold onto what’s wrong because you care about
what others think than it is to let go because that’s what’s
right for you. People will respect you far more if you can
acknowledge that you are an imperfect person—like everyone else—learning, adapting, and trying your best.
In reaching this mindset, you also open yourself up to
learning. By not assuming you know everything or that
you need to seem perfect, you can admit when you’re
wrong, ask for assistance, and lean on others sometimes.
Basically, you open yourself back up to growth, and your
life is better for it over the long term.
G U I LT O F S U C C E E D I N G
In a world of so much pain, horror, and misfortune, who
are we to have happy, abundant lives?
That’s the thought process that so many people go through.
One of the biggest mental barriers people face is the guilt
that comes with finally having enough or more than one
needs. This can come from many different sources, but it
ultimately boils down to feeling as though you “don’t deserve” to have it.
4 8 BRIANNA WIEST This feeling often comes up when we start to earn more
money or have nicer things. Often, people will sabotage
their higher incomes with reckless discretionary spending
or by being less vigilant about their clientele or workload,
because they are not quite comfortable having more than
the basic necessities, and so they put themselves back into
a comfortable feeling of lack.
When it comes to success, guilt is an unfortunately common emotion, especially for good-hearted people who
want to do the right thing and live authentic lives.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Please realize that most extremely successful people have
no guilt whatsoever. In fact, this feeling usually only comes
up when you’re stepping between not having enough and
finally having enough.
What you have to realize is that money and success are
tools. They buy you back time and offer you the opportunity to help, employ, influence, and change the lives
of others. Instead of looking at your success as a status
differentiator—which will always make you feel bad and
uncomfortable—see it instead as a tool with which you
can do important and positive things in the world and
your own life.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 4 9
FEAR OF FAILING
How often do we not even attempt something because we
are afraid to look bad or fail immediately?
The fear of failing is often something that holds people back
from putting in the work they would need to become truly
great at something, but it can also take another, more insidious form. Once we have established something new in our
lives, this fear can come up as a constant irrational worry
that we’re “missing something,” that our partner is being
unfaithful, or that we’re one misstep away from losing it all.
These catastrophic thoughts happen when we want to
shield ourselves from potential loss. They only come up
when we finally have something we care enough about
and really want to keep.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
There is a difference between failing because you are trying something new and daring, and failing because you
are not showing up, doing the work, or being responsible
for your actions.
These are two very different experiences and should be
separated in your mind.
As scary as it might be to not be great at something initially, or perhaps even experience a loss, it is even worse
5 0 BRIANNA WIEST to fail by virtue of never trying and always playing small.
Failure is inevitable, but you have to make sure it’s happening for the right reasons.
When we fail out of negligence, we take a step back.
When we fail because we are attempting new feats, we
take one step closer to what will work.
DOWNPLAYING
When we downplay our successes in life, we are either
trying to make ourselves seem less impressive so others do
not feel threatened and therefore like us more, or we are
trying to avoid the sense that we have “made it,” because
we are afraid of peaking.
Though so many of us long for the moment when we
feel as though we have finally arrived and achieved the
measures of success we so deeply desire, we often receive
them only to then feel as though they aren’t that great,
impressive, or that they don’t make us feel as good as we
thought they would.
This happens because of downplaying. The idea of having
“made it” makes us afraid that we are reaching the pinnacle and therefore will fall off of it. If we acknowledge that
we’ve arrived, what goals remain? It is a feeling akin to
death, so we instead find another measure to work toward.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 5 1
Likewise, when we are around other people, we do not
stand firmly in our pride because we are taught it is a bad
thing (and when done in an unhealthy way, it is). What
we are sensing is the feeling of being “better than” others
because we have achieved something. This makes us uncomfortable because we know it’s both untrue and unkind.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
We can all acknowledge and appreciate other people’s diverse accomplishments and talents while still being happy
about our own. Instead of shrugging off a compliment, we
can respond by saying: “Thank you, I worked very hard,
and I’m happy to be here.”
If the fear is that we are “peaking” too soon, we have to
reform our idea of progress. We do not get better only to
get worse again. We do not achieve one thing only to lose
it and return to what we were before. That instinct is a
self-sabotaging behavior, one that wants to keep us within
our old comfort zone.
Instead, we can acknowledge that when one part of our
life improves, it radiates out to everything else. When we
achieve one thing, we are better equipped for the future.
Life tends to gradually get better as we keep working on
it; it only gets worse if we accomplish something then
shut down because we are intimidated by our own power.
5 2 BRIANNA WIEST U N H E A LT H Y H A B I T S
This is the most common way that people sabotage their
own success: by maintaining habits that are actively keeping them away from their goals.
This is when someone declares that they want to be in
better shape but doesn’t change anything they do each day
to facilitate that. Or when they want to make a change
professionally but find ways to make it difficult if not impossible for them to actually do it.
At the core of all these behaviors is the fact that one part
of our psyche understands that we should be evolving and
moving forward with our lives and another part is intimidated by the potential discomfort it would bring. Usually,
this culminates in so much inner tension and frustration
that a breaking point is reached, and changes are made
from there.
However, the goal is to not have to get to a crisis point in your
life before you can become aware of the ways you’re holding
yourself back from living peacefully and comfortably.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Define health on your own terms. What does a healthy
life look like for you? How would it make you feel, and
what would you be doing?
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 5 3
It is difficult to look solely to anyone else’s definition of
healthfulness, particularly because we are all different
people with varying needs, preferences, and schedules.
Instead, figure out what makes you feel best. Decide what
combination of healthy eating, exercise, and sleep is right
for you, and stick to it. Like so many things, healthy habits
are best established gradually. Instead of trying to force
yourself to take an hour at the gym at 6 AM, try instead to
do 15 minutes, or perhaps swap out with a class you really
enjoy, or go at a time that works better for your schedule.
Make it easy for yourself to succeed. Prep your meals or
keep water by your desk so you can sip it throughout the
day. Gradually recondition yourself to prefer healthy habits, ones that actually work for your lifestyle.
BEING “BUSY”
Another very common way that people sabotage is by
distracting themselves to the point of being completely
phased out of their lives.
People who are constantly “busy” are running from
themselves.
Nobody is “busy” unless they want to be busy, and you will
know that because so many people with extremely hectic
schedules would never describe themselves that way. This
5 4 BRIANNA WIEST is because being “busy” is not a virtue; it only signals to
others that you do not know how to manage your time or
your tasks.
Being busy communicates importance; it often makes you
seem a little untouchable to others. It also overwhelms the
body so that it can only focus on the tasks at hand. Being
busy is the ultimate way to distract ourselves from what’s
really wrong.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
If your schedule is unmanageable, you’re never going to
be as effective or productive as you could be. If this is the
case, your first job has to be to streamline and prioritize
your tasks in order of importance, outsource whatever
else you can, and then let go of the rest.
If your issue is that you intentionally create chaos and
busy-ness in your day when there is no need for it, you
have to get comfortable with simplicity and routine.
Start with writing down your top 5 tasks that need to
be done each day, and then focus on doing those and
only those.
You might also need to confront the sense of “protection”
that being busy gives you. Does it make you feel more
important than others? Does it give you an excuse to say
“no” to plans or to avoid some people? You need to find
healthier and more productive ways to cope with these
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 5 5
feelings, such as finding genuine self-confidence in what
you do by creating something you’re proud of, or getting
better at calmly but clearly stating your boundaries and
needs in relationships.

It’s true that so much of our lives is shaped by the people
we spend them with, and the company you keep is another common way that people self-sabotage.
Certainly you can think of some people in your life who
stress you out, make you feel insecure, and yet keep you
coming back for more. These relationships exist at the
lighter end of the toxicity spectrum, but they are self-defeating nonetheless.
If you find yourself preoccupied with a certain friendship
or relationship that is making you feel almost addicted to
the feeling of being “less than” or “jealous of,” you need to
gradually phase out of it. You don’t need to be mean, rude,
or even cut anyone out of your life.
You do, however, need to understand that the people you
spend the most time with will shape your future irrevocably, and so you must choose them wisely.
5 6 BRIANNA WIEST HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Work on building a circle of people who support and inspire you, who have similar goals and enjoy spending time
with you. You should leave a get-together feeling energized and inspired, not exhausted and angry.
It takes time to find your group of friends, and you may
not discover that all at once. It could start with offering to
take someone you admire out for coffee, or reaching out
to do something with a person with whom you’d like to
reconnect. Slowly but genuinely rebuild your connections,
and then foster and care for them as much as you can.

AND LEAST LIKELY CIRCUMSTANCES
Another very common way that people sabotage without realizing is by preoccupying themselves with fears of
worst-case scenarios.
You’re probably familiar with this, at least to some degree:
You have a weird or highly unlikely thought that evokes a
deep sense of dread, fear, and series of “doomsday” scenarios in your head. You then keep coming back to it to the
point that it even controls some part of your life.
Irrational fears, especially the kind that are least likely to
become reality, are often what we project real fears onto.
THE MOUNTAIN I S YO U 5 7
These irrational fears are safe, because deep down we know
they aren’t going to happen. They are placeholders, a way
for us to express the feeling we really have onto something
we know isn’t going to happen.
When you find yourself in a fear cycle, constantly repeating some strange, random, or unimportant one-off
circumstance or situation that has a very low probability
of becoming reality, ask yourself if you have any feelings
about something related that is actually valid.
For example, if you get anxious about being a passenger in
a car, consider if your fear is of “moving forward” or being
“out of control.” Or, if you’re anxious about being fired from
your job, the fear might really be the idea that you aren’t
worthy of another job or being humiliated by a higher-up.
HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
Instead of wasting all of your energy trying to control
some worst-case scenario, consider what the message
of the fear may be and what it is telling you that you
need in your life.
If the fear was an abstract metaphor, what would the
meaning be? Is the abrupt loss of income a symbol of your
desire for security? Is the fear of the future a symbol for
not living fully right now? Is the anxiety about making
decisions a symbol for knowing what you really want and
being too afraid to choose it?
5 8 BRIANNA WIEST At the core of the things we most fear is a message that
we are trying to send ourselves about what we really care
about. If we can identify what we want to protect, we can
find healthier and more secure ways to do it.

SELF-SABOTAGE CYCLE
Even if you can cognitively understand self-sabotaging
behaviors, sometimes the most difficult shift is recognizing that we are engaging in them.
In fact, sometimes the signs are so subtle, they are barely
recognizable and often don’t come to our attention until
they become highly problematic or someone else points
them out. Some of the most prominent symptoms of
self-sabotage are as follows:
Y O U A R E M O R E AWA R E O F W H AT Y O U D O N ’ T WA N T T H A N
WHAT YOU DO.
You spend more of your time worrying, ruminating, and
focusing on what you hope doesn’t happen than you do
imagining, strategizing, and planning for what you do.

You are more focused on growing into the kind of person who evokes the envy of your supposed enemies rather
than the kind of person who is beloved by their family and
friends and prioritizes them no matter what.
YOU’RE PUTTING YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND.
You don’t know basic facts about your life, like how
much debt you have or what other people in your field
are being paid for similar work. When you get into an
argument, you run away until you forget rather than
talking about what’s wrong and coming up with a solution. In other words, you are in denial, and so any hope
of healing is futile.
Y O U C A R E M O R E A B O U T C O N V I N C I N G O T H E R P E O P L E
YOU’RE OKAY THAN ACTUALLY BEING OKAY.
You’d rather post photos that make it look like you had a
great time than being concerned about whether you actually had a good time. You put more effort toward trying
to convince everyone you’re doing well rather than being
honest and connecting with people who could help or
support you.
Y O U R M A I N P R I O R I T Y I N L I F E I S T O B E L I K E D, E V E N I F
THAT COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF BEING HAPPY.
You think more about whether or not your actions will
earn you the approval of “people” (who are “people,” by the
6 0 BRIANNA WIEST way?) rather than whether or not they will actually make
you feel fulfilled and content with who you are.
YOU’RE MORE AFRAID OF YOUR FEELINGS THAN ANY THING
ELSE.
If you get to the point in life at which the scariest, most
detrimental thing you face is the fear of whether or not
you will be able to handle your own emotions, you are the
one standing in your own way—nothing else is.
Y O U ’ R E B L I N D LY C H A S I N G G O A L S W I T H O U T A S K I N G
YOURSELF WHY YOU WANT THOSE THINGS.
If you are doing “everything you are supposed to be doing”
and yet you feel empty and depressed at the end of the day,
the issue is probably that you’re not really doing what you
want to be doing; you’ve just adopted someone else’s script
for happiness.
Y O U ’ R E T R E AT I N G Y O U R C O P I N G M E C H A N I S M S A S T H E
PROBLEM.
Instead of trying to incite war on yourself to overcome
your overeating, spending, drinking, sexing—whatever
it is you know you need to improve—ask yourself what
emotional need that thing is filling. Until you do, you will
battle it forever.
YOU VALUE YOUR DOUBT MORE THAN YOUR POTENTIAL.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 6 1
Negativity bias makes us believe that “bad” things are
more real than good, and unless we keep that inclination
in check, it can leave us believing that everything we fear
to be true is more real than the good things that are actually true.
YOU ARE TRYING TO CARE ABOUT EVERYTHING.
Your willpower is a limited resource. You only have so
much in a day. Rather than using it to try to become good
at everything, decide what matters most to you. Focus
your attention on that, and let everything else slip away.

BEEN WAITING FOR.
We grow up with the illusion that success is what’s handed
to people who are most deserving, talented, or privileged.
When we arrive, however, we realize it is constructed by
those who find an intersection of their interests, passions,
skills, and a market gap. Sprinkle on a little bit of persistence, and the only way to fail is to give up.
YOU DON’T REALIZE HOW FAR YOU’VE COME.
You are not the person you were five years ago. You evolve
as your self-image does, so make sure that it’s an accurate
one. Give yourself credit for everything you’ve overcome
that you never thought you would, and everything you’ve
6 2 BRIANNA WIEST built that you never thought you could. You’ve come so
much farther than you think, and you’re so much closer
than you realize.
I D E N T I F Y I N G Y O U R S U B C O N S C I O U S
COMMITMENTS
Part of the reason we often experience intense inner conflict or self-sabotage is because of something called a core
commitments, which is essentially your primary objective
or intention for your life.5
Your subconscious commitments are basically what you
want more than anything else, and you often aren’t even
aware of them. You can identify your core commitments
by looking at the things that you struggle with most and
the things you are most driven by. If you can peel back the
layers of your motivations toward each, you’ll find a root
cause. When you find the same root cause for everything,
you’ve found a core commitment.
People only seem irrational and unpredictable until you
understand what they are fundamentally committed to.
For example, if someone has a core commitment to feel
free, they may find themselves sabotaging work opportunities in order to achieve that. If someone’s core commitment is to feel wanted, they could find themselves
in a series of relationships in which they have intense
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 6 3
connections but refuse to make commitments out of fear
that the spark will “fade.” If someone’s core commitment
is to be in control of their lives, they might have irrational anxiety about things that represent a loss of control. If
someone’s core commitment is to be loved by others, they
might pretend to be helpless in certain areas of life because if they don’t need others, they might be left by them.
But the most important thing to understand is that your
core commitments are actually a cover-up for core needs.
Your core need is the opposite of your core commitment.
Your core need is also another way to identify your purpose. For example, if your subconscious core commitment
is to be in control, your core need is trust. If your subconscious core commitment is to be needed, your core need is
to know you are wanted. If your subconscious core commitment is to be loved by others, your need is self-love.
The less that you feed your core need, the
“louder” your core commitment symptoms
will be.
If you are a person who needs trust and is therefore committed to staying in control, the less that you believe you
are supported, the more your negative coping mechanisms
are going to flare up. Perhaps this could happen in the
form of disruptive eating patterns, isolating yourself, or
hyper-fixation on physical appearance. If you are committed to freedom and therefore need a sense of autonomy,
6 4 BRIANNA WIEST the less that you build a life on your own terms, the more
you are going to sabotage opportunities and feel drained
and exhausted when you “should” feel happy.
The more you lean into fulfilling your core needs, the more
your commitment symptoms will disappear.
Once you understand what a person really wants, you
will be able to explain the intricacies of their habits and
behaviors. You will be able to predict down to the detail
what they will do in any given situation. More importantly, once you start asking yourself what you really want,
you’ll be able to stop battling the symptoms and start addressing the only issue that has ever really existed in your
life, which is living out of alignment with your core needs
and, therefore, your core purpose.
CONFRONTING REPRESSED EMOTIONS
A N D TA K I N G A C T I O N
There is a difference between understanding why we
self-sabotage and the act of no longer self-sabotaging.
This means that once we understand the root and purpose of the behavior, we adjust it. We adapt. Overcoming
self-sabotage is not just a matter of understanding why
you’re holding yourself back; it is being able to take action
in the direction that you want and need to, even if it is
initially uncomfortable or triggering.
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 6 5
This is a very important part of the process, because you
are essentially going to be confronting the exact emotions
you have been trying to avoid.
When you stop engaging in self-sabotaging behavior, repressed emotions that you weren’t even aware of will start to
come up, and you might feel even worse than you did before.
The thing about overcoming self-sabotage is that we don’t
often need to be told what to do. We know what we want
to do, and we know what we need to do. It is simply that
we are being held back by our fear of feeling. To begin
to unravel this emotional holding pattern, we can work
through the following to find more ease and space and
freedom while we change our lives.

T H AT A R I S E W H I L E Y O U ’ R E B R E A K I N G
SELF-SABOTAGING BEHAVIORS
The first feeling you are likely to confront is resistance.
This is that generalized sense of being “stuck” or your body
feeling so tense that it is almost “hard,” as though you are
hitting a wall. This feeling is usually a masking emotion
that is preventing you from actually being aware of the
sensations beneath it which are more acute.
When you start to feel resistance, you don’t want to just
“push through it.” In fact, trying to do that means you’ll
6 6 BRIANNA WIEST keep hitting the same wall that you’re up against already.
You’re going to strengthen the self-sabotaging behavior
because you aren’t really solving the problem by just trying
to override it.
Instead, start asking the right questions.
Why do I feel this way?
What is this feeling trying to tell me about the action I am
trying to take?
Is there something I need to learn here?
What do I need to do to honor my needs right now?
Then you have to reconnect to your inspiration or your
vision for life. Get clear on why you want to take this action and make a change. When your motivation is the
fact that you want to live a different and better existence,
you’re going to find that a lot of the resistance fades because you’re being pushed by a vision that’s greater than
your fear.
In other cases, you might run into other emotions such
as anger, sadness, or inadequacy. When those feelings
come up, it is very important to make space for them. This
means to allow them to rise up in your body and observe
them. Watch where they make you tense up or constrict.
Feel what they want you to feel. There is nothing worse
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 6 7
than the fear of feeling the emotion, as the experience itself is ultimately often just some physical tension around
which we’ve crafted a story.
Remember that a lot of these feelings may very well have
a root in something related to the self-sabotaging behavior. If you are angry about how one of your parents treated
you, it probably won’t come as a surprise that the core feeling of why you are sabotaging your relationships is anger
and mistrust. The feelings associated with self-sabotage
are not usually random. In fact, they can lead us to deeper
insights about what we really need and what problems
within us are still unresolved.
To fully release those feelings once you are aware of them,
try writing yourself a letter. Write something to your
younger self or from the perspective of your future self.
Write down a mantra or a manifesto. Remind yourself
that you love yourself too much to settle for less, or that it
is okay to be angry in unfair or frustrating circumstances.
Give yourself space to experience the depth of your emotions so that they do not control your behaviors.
DISCONNECTING ACTION
A N D F E E L I N G
The final and most important lesson to overcome self-sabotage is to learn to disconnect action from feeling.
6 8 BRIANNA WIEST We are not held back in life because we are incapable of
making change. We are held back because we don’t feel like
making change, and so we don’t.
The truth is that you can have a vision of what you want,
know that it is undoubtedly right for you, and simply not
feel like taking the action required to pursue that path.
This is because our feelings are essentially wired as comfort systems. They produce a “good” feeling when we are
doing what we have always done—staying in familiarity.
This, to our bodies, registers as “safety.” In other cases, the
accomplishments or changes that we are very happy about
are those that we also perceive to offer us a greater measure of safety. If the achievement potentially puts us at
risk in any way or exposes us to something unfamiliar, we
aren’t going to be happy about it initially, even if it is a net
positive for our lives.
However, we can actually train ourselves to prefer behaviors that are good for us. This is how we restructure
our comfort zones. We begin to crave what we repeatedly do, but the first few times we do it, we often feel
uncomfortable. The trick is being able to override that
initial hesitation so we are guiding our lives with logic
and reason, not emotionality.
Though your emotions are always valid and need to be
validated, they are hardly ever an accurate measure of what
you are capable of in life. They are not always an accurate
THE MOUNTAIN IS YOU 6 9
reflection of reality. All your feelings know is what you’ve
done in the past, and they are attached to what they’ve
drawn comfort from.
You may feel as though you are worthless, but you most
certainly are not. You may feel as though there is no hope,
but there most certainly is. You may feel as though everyone dislikes you, but that is probably a gross overexaggeration. You may think everyone is judging you, but that is
a misperception.
Most importantly, you may feel as though you cannot take
action, when you most certainly can. You simply do not
feel willing, because you are not used to it.
By using logic and vision to guide ourselves, we are able
to identify a different and better life experience. When
we imagine this, we feel peaceful and inspired. To rise up
to meet this version of our lives, we must overcome our
resistance and discomfort. We will not feel happy initially,
no matter how “right” for us those actions are.
It is essential that you learn to take action before you feel
like doing it. Taking action builds momentum and creates
motivation. These feelings will not come to you spontaneously; you have to generate them. You have to inspire
yourself, you have to move. You have to simply begin and
allow your life and your energy to reorient itself to prefer
the behaviors that are going to move your life forward, not
the ones that are keeping you held back.
